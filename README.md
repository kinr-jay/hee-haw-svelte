# Hee-Haw Backcountry Expeditions

This is a web app where I can post the details on my backcountry adventures, and those who are registered users can sign up to participate. The frontend was built in Svelte.js. The backend API is built in Go with an Echo server. The backend interacts with a Heroku PostgreSQL database through the GORM library.
